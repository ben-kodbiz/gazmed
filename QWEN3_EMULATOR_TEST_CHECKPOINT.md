# üîç Qwen3-0.6B Emulator Testing Checkpoint

## üìç Current Status: APK Installation Issue

### What We've Accomplished
- ‚úÖ **x86 Emulator Running**: Medium_Phone emulator (emulator-5554) is active
- ‚úÖ **ARM APK Built**: 2.9GB app-arm64-v8a-debug.apk with Qwen3-0.6B model
- ‚úÖ **RAG Service Configured**: Using Qwen3-0.6B model for Arabic medical assistance
- ‚úÖ **Model Path Verified**: `assets/models/Qwen3-0.6B-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf`

### Current Issue: Installation Failure
```
APK Size: 2.9GB
Emulator Storage: 3.9GB available in /data
Error: INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE
```

### Emulator Details
- **Device**: Medium_Phone (x86_64)
- **Available Space**: 3.9GB in /data partition
- **Total Storage**: 5.8GB
- **Architecture**: x86_64 (incompatible with ARM64 APK)

### Next Steps After Reboot
1. **Option A**: Build x86_64 compatible APK without large model
2. **Option B**: Create larger emulator with more storage
3. **Option C**: Test on real ARM device instead
4. **Option D**: Remove model from APK and test RAG system separately

### Files Ready for Testing
- **APK**: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-arm64-v8a-debug.apk` (2.9GB)
- **Model**: Qwen3-0.6B configured in RAG service
- **Emulator**: x86_64 emulator running and ready

### Architecture Mismatch Note
The 2.9GB APK is ARM64 but emulator is x86_64. Even if storage issue is resolved, we may hit architecture compatibility issues.

## üéØ Recommended Next Action
Build a smaller test APK without the embedded model to test the RAG system architecture first, then add the model back once basic functionality is verified.
