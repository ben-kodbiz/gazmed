## 🏥 **Gaza-Specific Considerations**

### **Medical Accuracy Priority**
- Prioritize models with highest quality scores
- Validate emergency response accuracy
- Ensure appropriate medical disclaimers

### **Resource Constraints**
- Target devices: 1-2GB RAM smartphones
- Battery life: 4+ hours continuous use
- Storage: <500MB total app size

### **Offline Operation**
- All models must work completely offline
- No internet dependency after installation
- Local medical knowledge base integration
